# Contributing

1. Work on feature branches: `feature/<short-name>`.
2. Open PRs to `develop`. Require 1 reviewer.
3. Include tests and a demo snapshot for any change that affects engine logic.
4. Use the fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for deterministic runs.
5. CI workflow is a placeholder. Do not merge to `main` until CI is implemented.
