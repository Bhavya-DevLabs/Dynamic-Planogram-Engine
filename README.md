# Dynamic Planogram Engine (MVP)

This project contains a 4-phase intelligent planogram generation engine:

1. Phase 1 — Scoring (Robust SKU Prioritization)
2. Phase 2 — Allocation (Front vs Stock Facings)
3. Phase 3 — Placement (Brand Blocks + Look-Ahead Backfill)
4. Phase 4 — Optimization (Simulated Annealing + Orientation Rotations)

## Repository Structure

backend/
  Core logic implemented phase-by-phase

frontend/
  React interface for entering data and visualizing shelves

docs/
  Specifications, PRDs, and architecture notes

tests/
  Placeholder for automated tests (added later)

## Development Approach

All code will be generated iteratively using AI (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.).
Each file will be created one at a time to maintain clarity and prevent errors.
